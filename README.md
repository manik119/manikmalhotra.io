EVALUATING THE DETERMINANTS OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY PRICES: A COMPARATIVE MODEL ANALYSIS

This research explores the determinants of house pricing through the development and comparison of two predictive models. The independent variables used for the project are : Area, Number of Bedrooms, Number of Bathrooms, Number of Stories, Access to mainroad, Guestroom, basement, aircondinishing and number of parking spots.

The dependent variable of the project is Price.

Firstly, the data was explored where each independent variable is compared directly with the independent variable.

This exploratory research is was later compared and contrast with the superivised learning model created using multiple linear regression (MLR)

The MLR model had the accuracy of 64%, we can refer the accuracy to be less but accuracy of the model depends on industry to industry and for real estate industry the accuracy is sufficient.

The independent variables are ranked in the following order for significance -

1,Bathrooms 2,airconditioning(yes) 3,area 4,stories 5,parking 6,basement(yes) 7,mainroad(yes) 8,guestroom(yes) 9,bedrooms.
